/*
Assessment Requirements
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of players. What type of variable might this be?
2. Create an object inside your mintPlayer function that will hold the details for your players. 
   The details values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the player is ready, 
   you will store it in the variable you created in step 1.
3. Your listPlayers() function will print all of your players' details to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + player.name)).
4. For good measure, getTotalPlayers() should return the number of players you have added.

// Step 1: Create a variable to hold your players
let volleyballTeam = [];

// Step 2: This function will take in some values as parameters, create a
// player object using the parameters passed to it for its details, 
// and store it in the variable above.
function mintPlayer(name, position, jerseyNumber, height) {
  // Create a player object with details
  let player = {
    name: name,
    position: position,
    jerseyNumber: jerseyNumber,
    height: height
  };
  
  // Store the player in the volleyballTeam array
  volleyballTeam.push(player);
}

// Step 3: Create a "loop" that will go through an "array" of players
// and print their details with console.log()
function listPlayers() {
  // Iterate through the volleyballTeam array
  for (let i = 0; i < volleyballTeam.length; i++) {
    // Print each player's details
    console.log("Name: " + volleyballTeam[i].name);
    console.log("Position: " + volleyballTeam[i].position);
    console.log("Jersey Number: " + volleyballTeam[i].jerseyNumber);
    console.log("Height: " + volleyballTeam[i].height);
    console.log("--------------------");
  }
}

// Step 4: Print the total number of players we have added to the console
function getTotalPlayers() {
  // Return the length of the volleyballTeam array
  return volleyballTeam.length;
}

// Example usage:

// Adding some players
mintPlayer("Yuji Nishida", "Outside Hitter", 11, "6'1\"");
mintPlayer("Jenia Grebennikov", "Libero", 8, "6'2\"");
mintPlayer("Svetoslav Gotsev", "Middle Blocker", 5, "6'9\"");
mintPlayer("Bruno Mossa de Rezende", "Setter", 1, "6'3\"");

// Listing all players
listPlayers();

// Printing the total number of players
console.log("Total players: " + getTotalPlayers());
